# ðŸŽ¨ Color Palette Generator ðŸŽ¨

This project implements a simple color palette generator using machine learning techniques and serves as a perfect opportunity to explore and test the capabilities of Streamlit, an interactive web application framework for Python. 

The objective of this project is to leverage Streamlit's features and functionalities to create a user-friendly web interface for generating visually appealing color palettes. 

The color palette generator uses a KMeans clustering algorithm to identify the most dominant colors in an image. The image is first resized to a standard size to reduce computation time, and then the RGB values of each pixel are extracted and flattened into a 2D array. This array is then fed into the KMeans algorithm, which partitions the pixels into clusters based on their color similarity. The centroids of these clusters represent the dominant colors in the image and are used to generate the color palette.

By deploying the machine learning model on Streamlit, users can easily experiment with different input images, explore the generated palettes, and experience the seamless interactivity provided by Streamlit. 

This project showcases the integration of machine learning and web development, making it an ideal playground to test and explore the potential of Streamlit in real-world applications.
