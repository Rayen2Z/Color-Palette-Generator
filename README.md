# ðŸŽ¨ Color Palette Generator ðŸŽ¨

This project implements a simple color palette generator using machine learning techniques and serves as a perfect opportunity to explore and test the capabilities of Streamlit, an interactive web application framework for Python. 

The objective of this project is to leverage Streamlit's features and functionalities to create a user-friendly web interface for generating visually appealing color palettes. 

By deploying the machine learning model on Streamlit, users can easily experiment with different input images, explore the generated palettes, and experience the seamless interactivity provided by Streamlit. 

This project showcases the integration of machine learning and web development, making it an ideal playground to test and explore the potential of Streamlit in real-world applications.
